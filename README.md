The aim of this project is to bring web programming closer to the people, I plan to achieve this by allowing you to program a web page with blocks and then when you push to build it you will get real javascipt code that can be used on web pages. 
I'm planning to add an option to extend the capabilities by allowing you to use third party stuff, for example developing a game with THREE js
